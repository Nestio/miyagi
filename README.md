<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static site generator that helps you ship beautiful, accessible docs. For building our [documentation](https://docs.funnelleasing.com) portal, we have made certain modifications over the template generated by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to properly showcase all our products with their respective features and capabilities.

Our documentation covers five core products:
- **CRM**: Comprehensive customer relationship management for property managers
- **Online Leasing**: Streamlined digital leasing application and processing
- **Resident Portal**: Self-service portal for residents to manage their accounts
- **AI Virtual Assistant**: Intelligent chatbot and automation solutions
- **Voice AI & Insights**: Advanced call analytics and voice recognition

### Built With

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This section describes how you can get our documentation portal up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/funnelleasing/docs.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Run the app

```sh
npm start
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

<!-- In usage, mention how to edit the docs, how to update versions, etc. -->

### Writing Documentation

To edit existing documentation, navigate to the specific product folder you want to modify. For example, to edit CRM documentation, open up [docs/crm](./docs/crm) and edit the required files there.

To create a new version of a product's documentation, make your changes in the respective product folder under [docs](./docs). The `./docs` folder contains the current version of documentation.

After your changes are done, to create a version, run the following command:

```sh
npm run docusaurus docs:version:crm 1.2.3
```

This will create a new version `1.2.3` for the CRM product.

Reference: https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning

### To add new products

Create a new product section in docusaurus by adding a new plugin entry in [docusaurus.config.js](./docusaurus.config.js).

If you're adding a new product, just add new section to the `docs` array with the appropriate configuration.

Now, run `npm start` and you can access your new product docs at http://localhost:3000/[product-name]/introduction

Then, you can create versions and edit older versions as mentioned above.

### Adding new products to the Navigation

To add a newly created product to the Navigation Menu, edit [./src/sections.ts](src/sections.ts).

For example, for a new product called "maintenance", you will add:

```jsx
import { MaintenanceIcon } from '../assets/icons';

const SECTIONS = [
  // ...
  {
    id: 'maintenance',
    name: 'Maintenance',
    icon: MaintenanceIcon,
    section: 'property-management',
  },
];
```

You'll need to create a MaintenanceIcon component too.

That is it!
