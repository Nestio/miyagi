- question: What businesses can use Funnel Leasing?
  tags: ['General']
  answer: |-
    Funnel Leasing is designed for property management companies, rental communities, real estate professionals, and organizations that manage residential or commercial properties. It's ideal for businesses that need to:

    - Manage prospects and leads
    - Process rental applications
    - Handle lease transactions
    - Engage with residents through self-service portals
    - Track marketing attribution and lead sources

- question: What is the Customer API?
  tags: ['General']
  answer: |-
    The Funnel Customer API is provided to Funnel customers (property management companies) to integrate Funnel into internal systems and production workflows. Access is restricted to customer-authorized users, including internal engineering teams and approved development partners, using credentials issued for the customer's account.

    The Customer API allows you to:

    - Retrieve listings and related data for internal tools and customer-facing experiences
    - Integrate Funnel data with property management systems, CRMs, and operational workflows
    - Build dashboards and reporting pipelines based on Funnel data
    - Run scheduled synchronization jobs using supported sync endpoints
    - Automate operational processes that depend on Funnel data and events

    For more information, see [Customer API documentation](/apis/customer-api/)

- question: What is the Partner API?
  tags: ['General']
  answer: |-
    The Funnel Partner API is designed for building reusable integrations intended to serve multiple customers (not tied to a single customer account). If you are a third-party developer or integration partner building solutions that will be used by multiple Funnel customers, you should use the Partner API.

    The Partner API provides access to similar functionality as the Customer API but with different access controls and terms suitable for multi-tenant integrations.

    For more information, see [Partner API documentation](/apis/partner-api/)

- question: How do I get API access?
  tags: ['General']
  answer: |-
    To request API access, contact your Funnel customer service representative or email support@funnelleasing.com. Funnel issues API keys on request and configures them based on your intended use.

    When requesting API access, please provide:

    - Your customer account name and primary technical contact
    - Where the integration will run (server-side service, internal tool, website, etc.)
    - Whether the key needs to be used in a browser or other client-side environment
    - Any listing display requirements (for example, whether full addresses may be shown)
    - Expected volume and synchronization patterns (scheduled sync, near real-time, etc.)

    For more information, see [Authentication documentation](/apis/customer-api/authentication)

- question: What are Website Widgets?
  tags: ['General']
  answer: |-
    Website widgets are JavaScript-based components that you embed directly into your website's HTML. They enable you to:

    - **Capture leads** - Collect visitor information through customizable lead forms
    - **Schedule appointments** - Allow prospects to book appointments with your leasing team
    - **Provide AI chat support** - Offer instant assistance through an AI-powered chatbot
    - **Track marketing attribution** - Dynamically update phone numbers and capture campaign data based on UTM parameters and referrers

    Available widgets include:

    - **Lead Form**: Captures visitor contact information and creates leads in Funnel Leasing
    - **Appointment Scheduler**: Allows prospects to schedule appointments with leasing professionals
    - **Chatbot**: AI-powered chat widget that answers questions and captures leads
    - **Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI)**: Updates phone numbers on your site based on marketing sources

    For more information, see [Website Integration documentation](/integration/)

- question: What are Webhooks?
  tags: ['General']
  answer: |-
    Funnel Leasing Webhooks are messages about events that are sent via POST request from Funnel Leasing's servers to a user-defined callback URL that you own. They allow Funnel Leasing to automatically send real-time event data to your app when triggered by an event (like a unit being reserved, an application being completed, or a lease transaction being updated).

    You can think of webhooks as push notifications for servers. They enable you to:

    - Stay informed about crucial actions as they unfold within Funnel Online Leasing
    - Automate workflows based on Funnel events
    - Keep your systems in sync with Funnel data
    - Trigger actions in your systems when specific events occur

    Events are transmitted as `application/json` POST requests. For more information, see [Webhooks documentation](/webhooks/latest/)

# Technical FAQs
#

- question: How do I authenticate API requests?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    All requests to the Funnel Customer APIs must be authenticated using an API key issued for your customer account. Authentication uses HTTP Basic Authentication protocol.

    The username is your API key and the password is blank.

    **Example using curl:**
    ```bash
    curl --user <API_KEY>: https://api.funnelleasing.com/api/v2/onlineleasing-link/
    ```

    **Example using Python:**
    ```python
    import requests

    url = "https://api.funnelleasing.com/api/v2/onlineleasing-link/"
    response = requests.get(url, auth=("<API_KEY>", ""))
    ```

    For more information, see [Authentication documentation](/apis/customer-api/authentication)

- question: What is the API base URL?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    The Funnel Customer API base URL is:

    ```
    https://api.funnelleasing.com/api/v2/
    ```

    All API endpoints are relative to this base URL.

- question: Are there rate limits on the API?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    Funnel does not enforce a specific rate limit for requests made to our API, but simply asks that you be reasonable and polite. We will not limit your usage for normal website traffic, but we ask that you do not hammer our API with rapid requests made by an automated script. If you do, we will revoke your API access.

    If you have a use case that requires polling the API data for changes on a regular basis, or syncing large amounts of data at one time from the API to your system, we require using the **Listings Sync Endpoint**. We also have other technical solutions available that might better suit your needs. Please contact us, and we can discuss technical solutions that are mutually satisfactory.

    For more information, see [Usage & Terms](/apis/customer-api/usage-and-terms)

- question: What data formats does the API support?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    The Funnel Customer API uses JSON for request and response data. All API responses are returned in JSON format, and request bodies should also be sent as JSON with the `Content-Type: application/json` header.

    Webhook events are also sent as `application/json` POST requests.

- question: How do I set up webhooks?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    To set up webhooks, you need to:

    1. **Create an endpoint** - Set up a URL endpoint on your server that can receive POST requests
    2. **Configure the webhook** - Contact your Funnel customer service representative to configure webhook URLs for your account
    3. **Handle the events** - Implement logic to parse the JSON payload and handle the events you're interested in

    Webhook events are sent as `application/json` POST requests to your configured callback URL. You should implement proper error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes (200-299 for success).

    For more information, see [Webhooks documentation](/webhooks/latest/)

- question: What webhook events are available?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    Funnel Leasing provides a comprehensive set of webhook events that cover various aspects of the leasing process, including:

    - **Lease Transaction Events**: Unit reservations, releases, status updates, terms updates, fees updates
    - **Lease Events**: Move-in events, move-in cancellations
    - **Quote Events**: Quote creation
    - **Message Events**: Message send success/failure
    - **Agent Task Events**: Task status changes

    For a complete list of available events, see [Webhook Events List](/webhooks/latest/30-events-list/)

- question: How do I integrate widgets into my website?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    To integrate Funnel Leasing widgets into your website:

    1. **Obtain your credentials** - Contact your Funnel Leasing account representative or support team to get your API key and Community/Group IDs
    2. **Choose your widgets** - Determine which widgets best fit your website's needs (Lead Form, Appointment Scheduler, Chatbot, DNI)
    3. **Add script tags** - Include the widget's JavaScript file in your HTML
    4. **Initialize the widget** - Call the widget's initialization function with your configuration
    5. **Customize appearance** - Set colors, labels, and other styling options
    6. **Test and validate** - Verify that widgets are working correctly on your site

    Each widget follows a similar integration pattern. For detailed instructions, see the specific widget documentation:

    - [Lead Form Widget](/integration/lead-form)
    - [Appointment Scheduler Widget](/integration/appointment-scheduler)
    - [Chatbot Widget](/integration/chatbot)
    - [Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI)](/integration/dni)

- question: What programming languages can I use with the API?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    The Funnel Customer API uses standard HTTP REST APIs, which means you can use any programming language or framework that can make HTTP requests. Common languages include:

    - Python
    - JavaScript/Node.js
    - Ruby
    - PHP
    - Java
    - Go
    - C#
    - And many others

    Since the API uses standard HTTP Basic Authentication and JSON for data exchange, you can use any HTTP client library in your preferred language.

- question: Can I use the API in a browser or client-side application?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    API keys can be configured for different use cases. When requesting API access, specify whether the key needs to be used in a browser or other client-side environment. Funnel can issue public access keys that are appropriate for website frontends, or private access keys that are required for server-to-server API integration.

    However, for security reasons, it's generally recommended to use server-side integrations when possible, especially for operations that modify data or access sensitive information.

- question: How do I handle errors from the API?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    The Funnel Customer API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

    - **2xx**: Success
    - **4xx**: Client errors (bad request, unauthorized, not found, etc.)
    - **5xx**: Server errors

    Error responses include a JSON body with details about what went wrong. For more information about error handling and common error codes, see [Errors documentation](/apis/customer-api/errors)

- question: What is the difference between a prospect and an applicant?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    In Funnel Leasing:

    - **Prospect**: A potential renter who has expressed interest in a property but has not yet submitted a formal application. Prospects are typically leads that have been captured through your website, marketing campaigns, or other channels.

    - **Applicant**: A person who has submitted a formal rental application as part of a lease transaction. An applicant is associated with a specific lease transaction and may have a role such as "Primary Applicant", "Roommate", "Guarantor", "Occupant", or "Corporation".

    The progression typically goes: Lead → Prospect → Applicant → Resident

- question: What is a lease transaction?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    A lease transaction represents the process of leasing a unit, from initial interest through move-in. It includes:

    - The unit being leased
    - The applicants involved
    - Lease terms and conditions
    - Fees and charges
    - Status tracking (reserved, application in progress, approved, etc.)

    Lease transactions can be created, updated, and tracked through the API. Various webhook events are triggered as lease transactions progress through different stages.

    For more information, see [Lease Transaction documentation](/apis/customer-api/lease-transaction/)

- question: How do I retrieve listings data?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    You can retrieve listings data using the Listings API endpoints:

    - **Get a specific listing**: Retrieve details for a single listing by ID
    - **List all listings**: Get a list of all available listings
    - **Listings Sync**: Use the sync endpoint for efficient bulk data synchronization

    The Listings Sync Endpoint is recommended if you need to sync large amounts of data or poll for changes regularly, as it's optimized for these use cases.

    For more information, see [Listings documentation](/apis/customer-api/listings/)

- question: Can I customize widget appearance?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    Yes, Funnel Leasing widgets are customizable. You can configure various aspects of widget appearance and behavior, including:

    - Colors and styling
    - Labels and text
    - Size and positioning
    - Behavior and functionality

    Each widget has its own set of configuration options. Refer to the specific widget documentation for detailed customization options:

    - [Lead Form Widget](/integration/lead-form)
    - [Appointment Scheduler Widget](/integration/appointment-scheduler)
    - [Chatbot Widget](/integration/chatbot)
    - [Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI)](/integration/dni)

- question: How do I track widget events in Google Analytics?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    Funnel Leasing widgets can be integrated with Google Analytics to track user interactions and events. The widgets support callback functions that can trigger Google Analytics events when specific actions occur (such as form submissions, appointment bookings, etc.).

    For detailed instructions on setting up Google Analytics integration, see [Google Analytics Integration documentation](/integration/google-analytics)

- question: What happens if my webhook endpoint is unavailable?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    If your webhook endpoint is unavailable or returns an error, Funnel Leasing will retry the webhook delivery. The exact retry behavior depends on the type of error:

    - For timeouts and 5xx errors, Funnel typically retries multiple times with delays between retries
    - For 4xx errors (client errors), retries may not be attempted as these usually indicate a configuration issue

    It's important to ensure your webhook endpoint is reliable and returns appropriate HTTP status codes. Always return a 2xx status code for successful webhook processing.

- question: Can I test webhooks locally during development?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    Yes, you can test webhooks locally during development using tools like:

    - **ngrok**: Creates a secure tunnel to your local server
    - **localtunnel**: Similar to ngrok, provides a public URL for your local server
    - **webhook.site**: A service that provides temporary URLs for testing webhooks

    These tools allow you to receive webhook events on your local development machine for testing purposes.

- question: What information is included in webhook payloads?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    Webhook payloads include relevant information about the event that occurred. The exact structure depends on the event type, but typically includes:

    - Event type/name
    - Timestamp
    - Related entity IDs (prospect ID, lease transaction ID, etc.)
    - Event-specific data (status changes, updates, etc.)

    For detailed information about webhook payload structures, see [Event Object documentation](/webhooks/latest/20-event-object/)
