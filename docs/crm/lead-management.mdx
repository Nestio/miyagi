# Lead Management

Effective lead management is the foundation of successful property management. Funnel Leasing CRM provides comprehensive tools to capture, track, and nurture leads throughout the entire leasing process.

## Lead Capture

### Multiple Sources
Our CRM integrates with various lead sources to ensure no opportunity is missed:

- **Website forms** - Direct integration with your property website
- **Phone calls** - Automatic lead creation from incoming calls
- **Walk-ins** - Manual entry for in-person inquiries
- **Social media** - Integration with Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms
- **Third-party listings** - Zillow, Apartments.com, and other listing sites

### Lead Information
Capture comprehensive information about each lead:

- **Contact details** - Name, phone, email, address
- **Property preferences** - Budget, location, amenities, move-in date
- **Source tracking** - Where the lead originated
- **Initial notes** - First impressions and requirements

## Lead Scoring

### Automated Scoring
Our intelligent scoring system evaluates leads based on multiple factors:

- **Engagement level** - Website visits, email opens, call interactions
- **Property fit** - Match between preferences and available units
- **Timeline urgency** - How soon they need to move
- **Financial qualification** - Budget alignment with property pricing

### Custom Scoring Rules
Create your own scoring criteria:

```javascript
// Example scoring rule
if (lead.budget >= property.rent * 0.8 && 
    lead.moveInDate <= 30) {
    lead.score += 50;
}
```
