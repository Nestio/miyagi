The Lead Form widget allows you to capture visitor contact information directly on your website and automatically create leads in your Funnel Leasing account. This widget is ideal for collecting basic lead information from website visitors who want to learn more about your properties.

## Overview

The Lead Form widget displays a customizable form that visitors can fill out to submit their contact information. When submitted, the form creates a lead in Funnel Leasing and assigns it to the specified group.

## Prerequisites

Before embedding the Lead Form widget, ensure you have:

- **Funnel Leasing API Key** - Your company API key (provided by Funnel Leasing)
- **Group ID** - The ID of the Funnel group that will receive the leads
- **Website access** - Ability to add script tags to your website's HTML

<Callout type="tip">
Contact your Funnel Leasing account representative or support team at [support@funnelleasing.com](mailto:support@funnelleasing.com) to obtain your API key and Group ID.

## Installation

To embed the Lead Form widget on your website, add the following code to your HTML page where you want the widget to appear:

<CodeExample
  title="Installation code"
  language="html"
  formatLabel="HTML"
  code={`<script src="https://integrations.nestio.com/contact-widget/v1/integration.js" id="nestio-lead-capture-frame"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  NestioLeadCapture({
    "type": "lead_capture",
    "key": "FUNNEL_API_KEY_HERE",
    "group": FUNNEL_GROUP_ID_HERE,
    "color": "",
    "location": "",
    onComplete: function() {
      dataLayer.push({'event': 'lead-form-submission'});
    }
  });
</script>`}
/>

<Callout type="note">
Replace `FUNNEL_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key (as a string) and `FUNNEL_GROUP_ID_HERE` with your Group ID (as a number without quotes).
</Callout>

## Configuration

The Lead Form widget accepts the following configuration parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `key` | string | Yes | - | The company API key provided by Funnel Leasing |
| `group` | number | Yes | - | The ID of the Funnel group that will receive the leads. This group determines which users are assigned the lead |
| `type` | string | Yes | - | Must be set to `"lead_capture"` for the lead form widget |
| `containerId` | string | No | - | The ID of the div where you want your widget to appear. If not specified, the widget will create its own container |
| `color` | string | No | - | The brand color (6-digit hex code) used for submit buttons and header text |
| `location` | string | No | - | A custom location (such as a Building or specific Unit) to apply to the lead. Any location passed is saved on the client |
| `campaignInfo` | string | No | - | When not using Funnel's [DNI Script](/integration/dni), use this parameter to pass a value to Funnel for marketing attribution. The value must match exactly (case sensitive) the campaign name as entered in Funnel under marketing settings. When using the DNI Script, this parameter should not be used as it will overwrite the lead source |
| `onComplete` | function | No | - | A callback function that executes after the widget form is submitted. Useful for triggering analytics events (e.g., Google Tag Manager) |
| `submitLabel` | string | No | "Request Information" | Label that displays on the submit button on the client info form |
| `unit` | number | No | - | ID of Funnel Unit that the client will be associated with in Funnel |
| `buttonTextColor` | string | No | - | Color of the text on the submit button (6-digit hex code) |
| `textColor` | string | No | - | Color of the headers for each field on the widget (6-digit hex code) |

  code={`<script src="https://integrations.nestio.com/contact-widget/v1/integration.js" id="nestio-lead-capture-frame"></script>

    "key": "your-api-key-here",
    "group": 123,
    "color": "74FFE7",

/>

</Callout>

### Lead Form with Specific Container

A lead form that targets a specific div on your page:

<CodeExample
  title="Custom container"
  language="html"
  formatLabel="HTML"
  code={`<div id="my-lead-form"></div>

<script src="https://integrations.nestio.com/contact-widget/v1/integration.js" id="nestio-lead-capture-frame"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  NestioLeadCapture({
    "type": "lead_capture",
    "key": "your-api-key-here",
    "group": 123,
    "containerId": "my-lead-form"
  });
</script>`}
/>

## Widget Code Generator

Use the code generator below to create custom widget code with your specific configuration:

<WidgetCodeGenerator defaultWidgetType="lead_capture" />

## Widget Demo

See the Lead Form widget in action:

<LeadWidgetDemo />

## Marketing Attribution

The Lead Form widget supports marketing attribution in two ways:

1. **Using the DNI Script** (Recommended) - When using Funnel's [Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI) script](/integration/dni), marketing attribution is automatically handled. The DNI script captures UTM parameters and referrer information, which is then passed to the lead form widget.

2. **Using the `campaignInfo` parameter** - When not using the DNI script, you can manually pass campaign information using the `campaignInfo` parameter. The value must match exactly (case sensitive) the campaign name as entered in Funnel under marketing settings.

<Callout type="warning">
Do not use both the DNI script and the `campaignInfo` parameter together. If both are present, the `campaignInfo` parameter will overwrite the lead source passed by the DNI script.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Widget Not Appearing

- **Check script tags** - Ensure both script tags are present and in the correct order
- **Verify API key** - Confirm your API key is correct and wrapped in quotes
- **Check Group ID** - Verify your Group ID is a number (without quotes)
- **Browser console** - Check the browser console for JavaScript errors

### Leads Not Being Created

- **Verify Group ID** - Ensure the Group ID exists in your Funnel Leasing account
- **Check API key** - Confirm your API key has the necessary permissions
- **Network tab** - Check the browser's Network tab to see if requests are being sent successfully

### Styling Issues

- **Color format** - Ensure color values are 6-digit hex codes (e.g., `"74FFE7"`, not `"#74FFE7"` or `"74FFE7FF"`)
- **Container conflicts** - If using `containerId`, ensure the target div exists on the page

### Common Errors

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| API key is invalid | Contact Funnel Leasing support to verify your API key |
| Group ID not found | Verify the Group ID exists in your Funnel account |
| Widget not loading | Check that the script source URL is accessible and not blocked by ad blockers |
