</Callout>

## Overview

This section contains documentation for the legacy chatbot widget that was part of Funnel Leasing's earlier widget system. While this widget may still be functional for existing integrations, it is considered deprecated and will not receive new features or updates.

## Prerequisites

Before embedding the Legacy Chatbot widget, ensure you have:

- **Funnel Leasing API Key** - The API key provided by Funnel Leasing
- **Community ID** - The ID of the community the chatbot is associated with
- **Website access** - Ability to add script tags to your website's HTML

:::tip
Contact your Funnel Leasing account representative or support team at [support@funnelleasing.com](mailto:support@funnelleasing.com) to obtain your API key and Community ID.
:::

## Installation

To embed the Legacy Chatbot widget on your website, add the following code to your HTML page. The script should be placed in the `<head>` section or just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://chatbot.funnelleasing.com/funnel-chat.min.js"></script>
<script>
  window.addEventListener("load", function () {
    FunnelChat.initialize({
      apiKey: "YOUR_FUNNEL_API_KEY",
      communityId: "YOUR_COMMUNITY_ID",
      timeout: 5000,
      leadSourceId: 1234,
      defaultPaddingRight: "10px",
      defaultPaddingBottom: "10px",
      reactivePaddingRight: "20px",
      reactivePaddingBottom: "40px",
    });
  });
</script>
```

:::note
Replace `YOUR_FUNNEL_API_KEY` with your actual API key and `YOUR_COMMUNITY_ID` with your Community ID.

## Migration to Modern Chatbot

If you're currently using the legacy chatbot, we recommend migrating to the [modern Chatbot Widget](/integration/chatbot). The new widget provides:

- **Better AI capabilities** - Improved natural language understanding and response quality
- **Enhanced features** - Better integration with Funnel Leasing's AI systems
- **Improved performance** - Faster load times and better responsiveness
- **Active support** - Ongoing updates and feature additions
- **Better documentation** - Comprehensive guides and examples

To migrate:

1. Replace the legacy script source with the modern chatbot script
2. Update the initialization code to use `window.FunnelGenAIChat.initialize()` instead of `FunnelChat.initialize()`
3. Review the [Chatbot Widget documentation](/integration/chatbot) for the updated parameter list
4. Test the new widget on your website to ensure it works correctly
