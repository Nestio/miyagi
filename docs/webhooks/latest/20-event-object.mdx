Welcome to the documentation for Funnel Leasing’s Event Object. Here, you’ll learn how to seamlessly integrate event-driven functionality into your applications by listening to events generated within your Funnel Leasing account.

Funnel Leasing generates event data to keep you informed about activities related to your applications, residents, and units. These events are pivotal in maintaining the synchronicity between your systems and Funnel Leasing.
