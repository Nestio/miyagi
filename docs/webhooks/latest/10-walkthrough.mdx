This walkthrough provides comprehensive instructions for integrating Funnel Leasing Events and Callbacks (commonly known as “webhooks”) into your application. These webhooks deliver event metadata automatically whenever an action occurs within the Funnel Online Leasing product.

This resource focuses on implementation details, offers examples, and guides you through the process of working with webhooks. For a broader understanding of Funnel Leasing Events, please consult the Events Overview section in our documentation.
