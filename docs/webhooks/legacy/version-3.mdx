<Callout type="warning" title="Legacy Webhooks - Deprecated">
This webhook system is part of the legacy webhook infrastructure. For new integrations, we strongly recommend using the [modern webhooks v2](/webhooks/latest/) which provide better structure, more events, and improved reliability.
</Callout>

## Overview

A webhook enables Funnel to push real-time notifications to your application. When an event occurs, Funnel will attempt to make a POST request with JSON body to any applicable configured webhooks. This request will be considered successful with any 2XX or 3XX status code that returns within 5 seconds. If we receive any other response or the request exceeds the timeout, it will be considered a failure. Funnel will retry sending the event 3 times, for a total of 4 attempts before considering the event publish a failure.

## Webhook Configuration

Currently, the Funnel team needs to configure webhooks, so please reach out to your account manager or via Funnel Support to configure webhooks.

## Webhook Payload Structure

All webhook events follow a consistent payload structure:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String/UUID | A unique identifier for this event |
| `event` | String | The type of event (e.g., "lease.move_in", "lease.move_in_canceled") |
| `timestamp` | String/ISOTimestamp | The timestamp when the event occurred (ISO 8601 format) |
| `data` | JSON Object | The content of the event, varies by event type |

### Example Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "id": "3eb29a92-e480-40ee-9a9f-61fff5e3f3d5",
  "event": "lease.move_in_canceled",
  "timestamp": "2023-03-11T14:23:56.010+00:00",
  "data": {
    "move_in_date": "2023-03-11",
    "pms_identifier": "t0000000",
    "community_pms_identifier": "123"
  }
}
```

## Request Details

### HTTP Method and Headers

- **Method:** POST
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **Timeout:** 5 seconds

### Response Requirements

Your webhook endpoint should return:
- **Status Code:** Any 2XX or 3XX HTTP status code for success
- **Response Time:** Must respond within 5 seconds
- **Failure Handling:** Any other response or timeout will be considered a failure

### Retry Logic

If a webhook request fails, Funnel will retry sending the event:
- **Total Attempts:** 4 attempts (1 initial + 3 retries)
- **Retry Behavior:** Automatic retries for failed requests
- **Failure Handling:** After 4 failed attempts, the event publish is considered a failure

## Available Events

The following legacy webhook events are available:

- **[Lease Events](/webhooks/legacy/lease)**
  - [`lease.move_in`](/webhooks/legacy/lease#leasemove_in) - Triggered when a renter should be marked as moved in
  - [`lease.move_in_canceled`](/webhooks/legacy/lease#leasemove_in_canceled) - Triggered when a move-in should be canceled/reversed

## Usage Notes

### Implementing Your Webhook Handler

When implementing your webhook endpoint, ensure:

1. **Fast Response Times:** Your endpoint should respond quickly (ideally under 1 second) to avoid timeouts
2. **Idempotency:** Use the `id` field to ensure you don't process the same event multiple times
3. **Error Handling:** Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes
4. **Logging:** Log incoming webhook events for debugging and audit purposes

### Best Practices

- **Validate the payload:** Verify the structure and required fields before processing
- **Process asynchronously:** For time-consuming operations, acknowledge the webhook quickly and process the event asynchronously
- **Monitor retries:** Track failed webhook deliveries and investigate issues promptly
- **Test thoroughly:** Test your webhook handler with various event types and edge cases

## Migration to Webhooks v2

<Callout type="info" title="Recommended: Migrate to Webhooks v2">
For new integrations, we strongly recommend using the [modern webhooks v2 system](/webhooks/latest/), which provides:

- **Better event structure:** Consistent event object format with `id`, `event_type`, `event_timestamp`, and `event_data`
- **More events:** Comprehensive coverage of all Funnel Leasing activities
- **Improved reliability:** Better retry logic and error handling
- **Enhanced security:** Optional API token authentication
- **Better documentation:** Detailed payload schemas and examples

To get started, see the [Webhooks Overview](/webhooks/latest/) and [Webhook Walkthrough](/webhooks/latest/10-walkthrough).
