The data will be returned in paginated form with 50 listings per page, and can be filtered using query string parameters. The sync API uses pointer-based pagination. Each page of API results provides a pointer to the next available page. To get the pointer to the next page, look for the 'pointer.next_id' field in the response, and then pass that value as the max_id parameter to retrieve the next page. The Listings Sync endpoint is only available using Basic Authentication. Before you use the listings sync endpoint, please confirm with your Funnel representative that your Funnel plan includes sync access, and it is enabled for your API key."
