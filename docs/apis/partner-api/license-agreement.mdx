Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee agrees to report to Funnel any errors or difficulties discovered and the characteristic conditions and symptoms of such errors or difficulties.

## 7. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

THE FUNNEL API AND DEVELOPER DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND FUNNEL EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FUNNEL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNNEL API WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE, AND NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU FROM FUNNEL, THROUGH THE DEVELOPER DOCUMENTATION OR ELSEWHERE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY CONTENT OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE FUNNEL API IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF CONTENT. FUNNEL SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED, OR ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, BY THE INFORMATION OR FUNNEL OR CONTENT REFERENCED IN, APPEARING IN OR ACCESSED THROUGH THE FUNNEL API.

EXCEPT FOR LICENSEE'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS AND CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) WILL EITHER PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR FOR ANY TYPE OF INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE LOSS OR DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER LOSS OR DAMAGES INCURRED BY SUCH PARTY OR THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE FUNNEL API, OR THE DEVELOPER DOCUMENTATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND THAT FUNNEL WOULD NOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE FUNNEL WEBSITE ABSENT SUCH LIMITATION.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to Licensee. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, FUNNEL'S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. The limitations in this Section 7 will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

## 8. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Funnel, including its officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors from any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from (a) any use Licensee makes of the Funnel API or (b) Licensee's Application.

## 9. General Terms

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Florida without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law. All disputes arising in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts located in Tampa, Florida. No waiver of rights under this Agreement by either party shall constitute a subsequent waiver of any right under this Agreement and all waivers must be in writing. If any term of this Agreement is held by a court to be unenforceable, such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Licensee may not assign or transfer this Agreement (or any part hereof) without the prior written consent of Funnel. This Agreement does not create, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to establish, a joint venture between Funnel and Licensee, or the relationship of employer-employee, partners, principal-agent or the like. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing and sent (a) if to Funnel, at apisupport@funnelleasing.com, and (b) if to Licensee, at such email address as Licensee provides to Funnel on registering for the API (or, in either case, such address as a party may designate in writing). This Agreement and the Privacy Policy sets forth the entire understanding and agreement of the parties regarding the Funnel API and related Content and supersedes any and all oral or written agreements or understandings between the parties with respect thereto.
