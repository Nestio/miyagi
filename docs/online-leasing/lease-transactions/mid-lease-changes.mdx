# Mid-Lease Changes

The Mid-Lease Changes workflow allows property managers and agents to manage lease modifications and amendments throughout the lease term, ensuring flexibility while maintaining compliance and proper documentation.

## Overview

Mid-lease changes provide the ability to modify existing lease agreements without requiring a complete renewal or transfer process. This workflow streamlines common modifications such as roommate changes, rentable item adjustments, and fee modifications.

## Key Features

### Lease Detail Management
- **The system allows for the addition, removal, and management of lease details**, including roommates, rentable items, and fees.
- **Comprehensive tracking** of all changes made to the lease
- **Audit trail** for compliance and record-keeping purposes

### Roommate Change and Custom Screening
- **Roommate changes can be configured to adhere to custom screening rules**. For example, when adding a new roommate, the system will screen the new individual for credit, criminal history, eviction, and income, while only requesting new income information from existing roommates.
- **Flexible screening configurations** based on the type of change being made
- **Automated screening initiation** for new household members

### Roommate Change Fee
- **A fee can be applied when making changes to the roommate structure**
- **Configurable fee amounts** based on community policies
- **Automatic fee calculation** and application to the resident account

### Rentable Item and Fee Adjustments
- **Rentable items (e.g., parking, pets) and associated fees can be updated as needed**
- **Real-time inventory checking** for available rentable items
- **Automatic fee recalculation** when items are added or removed

### Automatic Addenda Generation
- **Addenda are automatically generated to correspond with lease changes**. For example, if a pet is added, the system will generate the animal addendum. Similarly, if a roommate is removed, the Roommate Release Form will generate automatically.
- **Template-based addenda creation** ensures consistency and compliance
- **Digital signature workflow** for all generated addenda

### Automated Task Configuration
- **Tasks can be configured to trigger upon completion of specific events**, ensuring that data management processes are seamlessly transferred to the property management system (PMS).
- **Customizable task assignments** based on role and responsibility
- **Integration with existing workflow systems**
