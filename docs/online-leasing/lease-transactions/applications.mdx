# Application Submission Workflow

## Application

**Overview:** Funnel's Online Leasing application workflow allows customers to collect important information relevant to an applicant, all while providing a seamless experience that's unmatched in the industry.

**Starting an Application:**

- **Agent Invitation/Quote:**
    - Customizable application portal is created for each community.
    - Agent can invite primary applicants to start applications
    - Agent can manage applicants at any point prior to approval (invite or remove roommates, guarantors, or occupants)
- **Website Application:**
    - Customizable application portal is created for each community.
    - Ability to configure unit level specific application links with [third party integrations](https://developers.funnelleasing.com/api/v2/onlineleasing-link.html), allowing your website to point directly to the Funnel OL experience.

**Managing an Application:**

### Unit Selection
- **Real Time Pricing and Availability** is pulled directly from the PMS (or revenue management) when selecting a Unit, Term, and Start Date
    - **Overview:**
        - Restrict the available move in dates based on availability. For example, we have the ability to select a unit for move-in based on the unit's initial availability date or select a unit if the unit's availability date is outside of the Unit Availability range (future availability).
        - Create Black Out Dates for specific days of the week that do not allow lease starts/move ins
        - Restrict available lease terms
        
        In admin, a user can control when units are available for selection for the agent and applicant by editing specific unit availability configurations. The admin will have the ability to edit the following settings:
        
        - **Accepted Lease Start Date range**
            - Specifies the wider range of when an agent or applicant can select a unit.
                - Example: The range is set to 180 days. The applicant goes to pick a move in date on the renter experience, the applicant can select any day from today to 180 days out on the calendar.
            - It will also impact the quote creation process for the agent.
            - This is available at the management company level and the community level. If the community level is configured, it will override the management company level setting.
        - **Unit Availability range**
            - Specifies a short range where an agent or applicant can only select a unit for move-in based on that unit's initial availability date.
                - Example. The lease start date range is 180. Unit Availability is set to 10. When the applicant goes to pick a move in date- they can see up to 180 days out. However, if the applicant chooses a unit that becomes available on May 1, for example, within the 180 days, the applicant will only be able to select May 1-10 as a move in date. The Unit availability move in dates are based on the day the unit becomes available.
            - This impacts the quote creation process for the agent.
            - This is available at the management company level and the community level. If the community level is configured, it will override the management company level setting.
        - **Future Availability range**
            - Specifies when an agent or applicant can select a unit if the unit's availability date is outside of the Unit Availability range (considered a "future" status). This is usually a much shorter range. Example: 1-3 days of availability for move-in.
            - This impacts the quote creation process for the agent.
            - This is available at the community level.
            
            **Steps to Configure in admin:**
            
            - Under management company settings
                - Go to Online leasing and the field for Accepted lease start date
            - Under community settings (this configuration can be left blank if not needed for the community. The company values will be the default)
                - Go to Online Leasing section and look for the following fields:
                    - Accepted lease start date
                    - Future availability (only available at the community level)

### Adding Individuals
- **Applicants can add Roommates, Occupants, Dependent, and Guarantors (optional)** to an application from the Rental Profile page
    - Clarification and call out on dependents: Yardi does not explicitly state dependent but Funnel does. In Funnel, an "Occupant" = a non-lease holder who is authorized to live in the unit over the age of 18 / must create an account. In Funnel a "Dependent" = non-lease holder authorized to live in the unit under the age of 18 / does not create an account.
- **If an individual needs to be added to an application after the initial application has been submitted**, the employee managing the application can simply invite other individuals to apply from the 'Household' section on the lease transaction page.
    - Primary applicants can only invite Roommates and Guarantors, and add Dependents. Only agents in funnel can invite/add Occupants or change roles to occupants

### Adding Rentable Items
- **Applicants can add rentable items/rental options** (i.e. pets, parking, etc.) dependent on what's configured for the community being applied to. This is done via the Rental Profile page on the application
- **Employees have the ability to add additional rentable items** post-application submission
- For more details on rental options, please see the [Rentable Items](#rentable-items) section below

### Housing Authority Vouchers
- **Funnel enables applicants to upload Housing Authority vouchers** directly in the applicant portal and allows agents to review, manage, and approve these vouchers seamlessly.
- **By integrating vouchers into the application and lease process**, this feature streamlines workflows for applicants and agents, ensuring compliance and accuracy in financial documentation.

### Verifying Income and Identity Information
- **Funnel's application workflow allows customers to capture all relevant income and identity information** within the application workflow, eliminating the need for unnecessary post application follow up
- **Funnel can verify applicants' income** both via a direct bank link and the uploading of income documents
- **Funnel can verify applicants' identity** via a PII scan and/or a document and liveness verification (ie selfie verification)
- **Income and Identity verification results are returned back to Funnel** where a team member can reference when decisioning on an application
- For more details on Income and Identity verification, please see the [Fraud & Screening](../screening-fraud-prevention/) section

### Screening
- **Within the application workflow, Funnel requests a PII identifier** that's then passed to the screening provider (TransUnion) to conduct a credit, criminal, and eviction review for the applicant
- **Screening reports and results are returned automatically back to Funnel** where an employee can reference when decisioning
- **Configurations can be made depending on the jurisdiction** to ensure compliance with local and federal laws
- **If an applicant passes credit, eviction, criminal, and income, Funnel has the ability to automatically notify your applicant of their status.**
- For more details on Screening, please see the [Fraud & Screening](../screening-fraud-prevention/) section

## Rentable Items

### Rentable Items Request Selection
- **Rental Item Selection (optional/custom per community)**
    - Applicants may select rental items; however, the specific assignment of rental options (such as parking and storage) is handled by the agent through the "Manage Application" page.
        - Funnel syncs with Yardi to verify the availability of inventory for items such as parking spaces and storage units (Requires Yardi Rentable Item configuration - Funnel's preferred method)
    - Currently Included Inventory Options:
        - Parking: Multiple parking types like garages, carports, and assigned or unassigned parking may be available, depending on the community.
        - Storage: Various storage options like small, medium, or large storage rooms may be available, depending on the community.
        - Wine cooler

### Specific to Pets
- **When an applicant submits their application. In the application, the following fields are collected:**
    - Breed (Dogs)
    - Weight
    - Name (refer to the section below for further details)
    - Service Animal
- **Warning messages can be generated by the system** if a pet's weight exceeds the community's specified restrictions.
- **Funnel can house pet policy information within the system** and it can be displayed to applicants while they are entering their pet details.

## Payments

### Payment Capturing via Stripe
- **Funnel collects Application fees on a per-applicant basis**
- **Funnel can collect a Holding Deposit (customizable label)** that is authorized and funds are verified, but not transacted until decision is made or the time threshold is reached:
    - Upon approval, all charges are processed
    - If the application is declined or canceled prior to the set time threshold, the application fees are processed, and the holding deposit is refunded.
    - If no decision is made and the set time elapses, both the application fees and holding deposit are processed.
    - Funnel offers additional settings on the agent view to allow for refunds of transacted holding deposits upon cancellation or denial if the decision is made after the funds have been captured.
- **Applicants can use a credit or debit card** to make payments for the application fee and holding deposit.
- **Primary applicants have the ability to make payments on behalf of others** within their application (e.g., roommate or guarantor).
- **Agents with the appropriate permissions can submit an "admin-managed application"** (also referred to as a "paper application") on behalf of the renter in cases where the renter does not have an email or is unable to submit electronically. In such cases, the property management company (PMC) collects the necessary information, and the agent manually enters the application into Funnel.
- **Application fees and administration/holding deposit amounts are assigned at the beginning of the application.** Therefore, if fee prices change, this will not affect any in-progress applications but will apply only to new applications submitted after the fee updates.

## Agent "Log in as Applicant" Feature

- **Optional Role Permission**: Agents can be granted permission to log in as and impersonate an applicant, helping to troubleshoot issues.
- **Restriction on Document Signing**: Additional restrictions are in place to prevent agents from signing any documents on behalf of the applicant during impersonation.
- **Timeline Logging**: All events, including impersonation actions, are logged in the timeline to ensure transparency and accountability.

## Automated Marketing Triggers

Here is a list of all of the available **Automated Marketing Triggers**. These triggers allow companies to program custom rulesets (if this, then that) to create agent tasks or even schedule custom email or SMS messages to send to the applicant or resident after a specific event or action has been taken in Funnel. You may choose to enable any combination of these for your communities and determine the copy to be sent. Automated marketing triggers relevant to our OL workflows are:

## Reports

- **Payment Reports**: Funnel's online leasing payment workflow includes reporting that mirrors the current reports received from Yardi and the payment processor.
- **Refund Reports**: Funnel provides detailed Stripe refund reports at the property and applicant level, facilitating efficient refund reconciliations.
- **Applicant Reports**: Funnel offers comprehensive reporting and access to data that clients previously lacked, including insights into quick failed identity reports and more.

## Additional Considerations

### Recommendation
- It is recommended to select pilot properties in jurisdictions where Funnel is already live, to streamline the implementation process and mitigate risks associated with additional development requirements.
    - For capabilities not currently available to support specific state or city regulations, Funnel will enable these as part of ongoing product development.
    - For capabilities that do not align with the client's specific processes or functions, these will be scoped as part of a Professional Services engagement, should they not be included in our product roadmap.

### Funnel Payments for Application Payment Collection
- Funnel will manage application payments for the client and set up the client team as a Connected Account Owner.
    - Funnel's payment workflow leverages credit card authorizations to ensure funds are held while the application status is pending.
    - This approach minimizes credit card risk and ensures the client receives payment for application fees.
    - Refunds are processed automatically via Stripe, eliminating the need for manual check issuance.
    - Funnel will automatically push payment events (e.g., charges, refunds, chargebacks) to Yardi.
    - Detailed reports will be provided to assist with reconciliation.

### TransUnion and Stripe Account Setup
- **TransUnion**:
    - Funnel will facilitate a meeting with TransUnion's representatives and begin the credentialing process. TransUnion will manage the credentialing process directly with the client.
    - Timely credentialing is crucial, as processing may take several weeks.
    - If Two-Phased Screening is required in a jurisdiction that does not legally mandate it, the client must notify both TransUnion and Funnel.
- **Stripe**:
    - Funnel will create Stripe bank accounts for each of the client's communities.
    - A unique link will be generated for each account, which will be sent to a designated client representative for account setup.
    - Required information for setup includes:
        - Company details
        - Business address
        - EIN (Employer Identification Number)
        - Company representative details (name, position, date of birth, SSN)

### Application Process
- The application process will be powered by Funnel, configured according to the client's specifications based on the available configuration options, rather than using an NAA/TAA-based application.

### Plaid Income and Asset Reports
- Specific Plaid terms must be agreed upon to access the Income and Asset Reports generated by Plaid during the bank link income verification process.
    - **Note**: While the income amounts will still flow into Funnel and contribute to the income/asset multiplier decision, the document summary itself will not be visible.

### Yardi Integration Limitations
- **Lease Reconciliation Process**: The post-lease import reconciliation process must be used when importing non-Funnel generated leases.
- **Operational Process**: An operational process must be established to ensure Yardi remains synchronized for lease transactions after the resident becomes current.

### Assumptions to Validate
- **Lease Renewals**: Lease renewals will be managed via Online Leasing (OLL).
    - Lease offers must be generated and approved in Yardi. Funnel will ingest these offers, present them to residents, and then push selections to Yardi.
- **Resident Onboarding**: Resident onboarding is not included within the OLL process.
- **NAA/TAA Application Workflows**: Funnel does not currently offer NAA/TAA application workflows. These are on our product roadmap, with a release date TBD.

### Historical Data Migration / Cutover
- **Phased Communities**: Please identify any phased communities and provide details on any necessary accounting for:
    - Blue Moon accounts per phase
    - Yardi accounts per phase
    - Stripe / depository accounts per phase
    - Pricing differences per phase (these must be managed by assigning unique layouts to particular fees).

### Corporate Tenant Applications
- Corporate tenant applications must be submitted manually by agents. Digital corporate applications are on the roadmap, with a release date to be determined.
