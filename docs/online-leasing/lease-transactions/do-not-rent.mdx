# Do Not Rent Workflow

The "Do Not Rent" (DNR) workflow is a critical component of Funnel Leasing Online Leasing that helps property managers identify and manage individuals who should not be approved for tenancy based on specific criteria.

## Overview

The Do Not Rent workflow is typically used to identify bad actors or individuals involved in evictions or collections. This system provides a comprehensive solution for managing DNR lists, automatic denial recommendations, and compliance with fair housing regulations.

## Key Features

### DNR List Management

- **Permission-based access** to DNR list management
- **Audit trail** for all DNR list modifications

### Automatic Denial Recommendations
- **A specific reason for denial is associated with the Adverse Action Notice (AAN) generated for DNR-related denials.**
- **Automated matching** against DNR list during application processing
- **Immediate denial recommendations** when matches are found
- **Compliance-driven denial reasons** for proper documentation

### Compliance and Documentation
